The LGJCbord struct memory layout:
      000: Status of thing. 0 means none, 1 means its there, 2 means something about updating
      005: serial port object
      008: set to value 28 on init
      009: set to value 32 on init
      010: set to value 00 on init
      012: Set to 1 on init
      016: Set to 0 on init
      018: Open Fail is 0x00 Success is 0x01
      020: The serial port object probably
      024: CBord enable
      025: Check of CLASS RECEIVE BUFFER OKAY? set to 0 on init // Might mean seat ini file exists?!
      026: wont send if 1 (test mode no send?)

      031: Some variable that causes a branch
32 -> 037: CLASS SEND BUFFER
38 checksum variable
39 -> 045: SERIAL SEND BUFFER
46 -> 067: CLASS RECEIVE BUFFER
68 -> 195: SERIAL RECIEVE BUFFER
      196: int sent okay? set to 0 on init
      200: int Received Status? gets set to 1 on init

      209: First byte of sent message can be (0x11, 0x17 = 0x19 response) (0x00, 0x12 = 0x6) THIS IS CONFIRMED - 3 seems to be faliure.

      212: The Buttons. made up of a 24bit number from (50, 51, 52) This is a DWORD so probably up to 215 (50 0x10 is initialise button)
      213: Bit masks of limit sensors (This is correct, seat lock/unlock is 0x2)
      214: Bit masks of limit sensors
      215: Bit mask of sensors etc.
      216: Set to 0 if the bit 5 (from the right) of 52 doesn't equal 0 (could also be 50 I don't know what HYBYTE does) starts as 1
      217: Set to 0 if the bit 6 of 52 doesn't equal 0
      218: Sets what in 34 (Probably seat command?)
      236: soem counter float thing?
      240: Some variable set to 0x0 on init (GETS THE NUMBER FROM 49 PUT IN THERE)
      241: possibly the last position
      256: Gets set to 0 when seat stop - possibly a position?

      260: Gets set to 1 when seat stops, and has not not be 2 to set seat to stop
      268: Gets set to something when seat stops

      289: sets whats in 35


      292 - 304 - Some sort of counters that go down by 1 each time. Once the counters reach 0 289 gets bits mashed off.

      308: seems to be outputs? gets put into 36
      310: Life LED? Shows life counter on an LED maybe?

      312: gets set to 0xff on test mode.

      313: Something about teest mode populates 37.
      314: seems to be outputs?
      320: means seat it okay? Might be front or rear position selector?

      324: COUNTER RELATED TO 47
      328: Gets set to value in 47 if value in 47 is less than 4
      332: COUNTER RELATED TO 53
      336: Gets set to what was in 53 - initially set to
      340: Equals 53 + 200 if 255 (Some seat thing) != 1;

      364 -> 396 - Somthing to do with hard air report
      400 -> 404 - Something to do with timing of hard-air-report (Old time save variable)
      404 - think its 404 big?

32 - 0xC0
33 - 209 (Command)
35 -> 289 (or 0 in test mode when 33 is 0x13)
36 -> 308
37 -> 313 (or 0 in test mode when 33 is 0x13)

41 - Has the seat command in it

SEND:
  32 - 0xC0
  33 - Takes from 209 which is the command that is set I think (Gets from class command)
  34 - set to 0 - gets from 218 (SEAT COMMAND - This is the one that is displayed)
  35 - Set to 0 if on test mode or whats in 289 if notg (This seems to be some sort of bit patten)
  36 - Gets set to 308 - Possibly Outputs? (it at 1 on startup)
  37 - set to 131 if not in test mode? - Gets data from 313
  38 - Checksum

RECEIVE:
  46 - 0xC0
  47 - If less than 0x4 324 gets incremented by one, and 328 gets set to this
  48 - This gets checked at the startup, and if its 16 or 26 something else happens (26 looks like it means it works!) - should not equal -1? If it equals 26 the ride is stopped. If this equals -1 and not 0 then it should go strait to failure.
  49 - Must be less than or equal to 0xC and 49 & 0xf != 0x0 can be (1,3,5,11)
  50 - DWORD - LOW BYTE      |   -- SEEMS TO GET SET TO RETURN STATUS? I think these are the switches &0x10 is initialise
  51 - HIGH BYTE     |       (THIS REQUIRES TO BE && with 0x10 and 0x20 to make some other things 0 - so probably a good start)
  52 - HIGHEST BYTE  |
  53 - if <= 10 does some counter stuf

# How it works

If there is no seat_init file it will turn the number 01 which mean initialise. This comes from position 209 -> 48.

if(&66 != 0) {
  &236 = &66 * 0.020807063;
} else {

  &236 = 1065749138;
}


if 48 == 0x10 then reply 16
if 48 == 0x12 then reply 18

Something to do with 0->10 and then 200->209 - some strange counter maybe?




FOR TEST TO work
340 must equal 0 for the tests to work! How do we get this to happen?
25 must equal 1




- It uses _sInterface::checkTrgOn(1, 0x4000); to initialise. We could change this code so it just equals 1.

LOBYTE(v1) = _sInterface::checkTrgOn(1, 0x4000);
      if ( (_BYTE)v1 )
      {
        v46 = g_pCbord;
LABEL_74:
        *((_BYTE *)v46 + 209) = 3;
        *((_DWORD *)this + 20) = 4;
        LOBYTE(v1) = gsysMessage::setMsg(g_pMessage, 1, 3, 0);
      }
